# FB Merch

A custom-built inventory management web app designed for **Funky Buddha Brewery** to streamline and modernize their merchandise operations.

## 🧾 Overview

The **FB Merch App** was created to solve inefficiencies in how Funky Buddha Brewery managed its merchandise inventory. Much of the merch is stored in the back of their 100,000 sq. ft. facility, causing delays when customers requested items not immediately available up front. Employees often spent 5–10 minutes retrieving items, leading to longer wait times, potential lost sales, and wasted effort — especially during busy taproom hours.

The app enables employees to instantly check inventory levels, view what’s in stock or out of stock, and update counts in real time as items are pulled. This keeps everyone aligned and significantly reduces the time spent on manual inventory checks — what once took 3–4 hours can now be reviewed within minutes.
